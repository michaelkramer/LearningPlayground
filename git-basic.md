# Git commands that I keep forgetting

#### Creating a branch

1. `git checkout -b branch-name`
  This will checkout a new branch with that name.
2. `git add ./`
  This stages all files that you touched for the next commit. The `./` means all
3. `git commit -m 'Your amazing message'`
  This is the commit command.
4. `git push --set-upstream origin branch-name`
  This pushes your branch to the remote.
